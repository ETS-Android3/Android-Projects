A project that models a contact app that hosts pictures and info about my favorite musicians/artists.
Features a recycler view that updates whenever changes to the list of musicians are made, as well as packages like Glide
which lets the user submit images when creating a new contact by pasting in a link to an image.
Can be built with Android Studio, I recommend downloading the zip file as this one has been truncated to upload to GitHub.
